# IPL-Win-Probability-Predictor
In this project, I've made a Machine Learning model which predicts the win probability of an IPL team during the 2nd innings of a match.
It is run over Jupyter Notebook. Numpy and Pandas library have been used for data cleaning and manipulation, Scikit-Learn library for model prediction and Matplotlib library for visualizations.
Realistic values are predicted and progress of the innings can be interpreted using interactive visualizations.
